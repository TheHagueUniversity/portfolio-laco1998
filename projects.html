            <p id="descriptionOne">Bringing digital gift unwrapping closer to the real one is the goal of this app. It is an AR unwrapping experience suited mainly for football and gaming fans. In order to get to the game, the user has to receive a special Hallmark card. In the hallmARk app the receiver can scan the card, and start playing a challenging AR football game. After successful completion of the game, there is a gift waiting for the player. This is not a fully functional app, it is just an ADOBE XD prototype.</p>

            <p id="descriptionTwo">Making and sending postcards seems old-fashioned nowadays, but it does not have to be. Imagine the process of creating a postcard being fully powered by an artificial intelligence, and all the user needs to do is enter keywords. Well that is exactly what this app is about. And the best part? All the AI created designs are fully customizable. As a bonus, to better convey an emotional message recording a voice message is also possible. Adding photos and texts that goes without saying. This is not a fully functional app, it is just an ADOBE XD prototype.</p>

            <p id="descriptionThree">Learning a new language is not an easy task, especially in a country like The Netherlands, where everybody speaks English. Thanks to the Nervous Maker Pro, learning a new language does not feel like learning at all! It forces people to speak a foreign language, by making them nervous and punishing them for not learning. This concept video is a result of a group project, which I was part of. During this project we went through all stages of a design thinking process â€“ empathize, define, ideate, prototype, test. </p>
