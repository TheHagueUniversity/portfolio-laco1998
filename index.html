            <h1 id="aboutMe">ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p id="overview">I am a first-year undergraduate user experience student at The Hague University of Applied Sciences. I grew up in Bratislava, Slovakia, but for the past two years, I have been living in The Netherlands. I am a very curious and open-minded person always striving for new challenges, therefore I moved to a foreign country. As I was a professional tennis player, sport shaped me as a person. Tennis gave me self-discipline, great time management skills and it taught me how to work individually. <br> <br> Since I am a very goal-oriented person, with my designs I have a goal to make today's world less complicated and more enjoyable.</p>
