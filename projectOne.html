            <p id="descriptionOne">Once the receiver gets his card, he will be prompted to download the app with a message on the envelope, as well as a more detailed instructions card. When they scan the card with the app, an augmented reality experience will start. A football field will appear in front of the card, with the card itself acting as the goal. The playerâ€™s phone can connect to the speaker built into the card to create a surround sound effect, and humorous commentary and background music will play during the game. The player can shoot the ball by swiping it on the touch screen, and they have to score at least 4 goals out of 6 attempts to win the game. If they win, an image and description of the gift as input by the giver will pop up, along with a button to redeem the gift and they will be encouraged to send a card back to the giver. If they lose, they will have to try again. Based on the design vision, the game will be fairly challenging.</p>

            <p id="descriptionTwo">The final concept is a single app that can be used by both the giver and the receiver of the card. The card personalisation tool will help the giver while designing the card and writing the text. In the first step, the giver can input keywords about the receiver, what kind of person they are, their hobbies, their relationship with the giver, etc. An artificial intelligence will use these keywords to provide tips and suggestions throughout the creation process, and will create a suggested design for the card. The suggested design will change constantly as the giver inputs keywords, and it is entirely up to them how many keywords they want to input.<br><br>
                
            Afterwards, the giver can fully customise the card. Every element put there by the AI can be changed or deleted, and the giver can add their own pictures and text, as well as stickers from a built-in collection. A voice message can also be added, which will play through a speaker built into the card. This message can be recorded directly in the app, or an already recorded file can be uploaded. Other people can also be invited to leave a voice message of their own, and background music can be added to give life to the message. Finally, a gift can be added that the receiver can access after completing a game during the unwrapping experience, and the giver has a chance to upload a picture of their face, which will be used for the opponent in the game. </p>
